//README.md

This is a repository for creating an art auction website, apps, and dapps where clients are able to place bids on artwork in Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Fiat currency.



Some of the prerequisite packages are the following:

solidity, solc, node-js, npm, web3, ganache-cli, truffle, Docker, Docker Compose, nodejs, java, sqlite

I am currently working on creating the imgur hashes that will reference the artwork.  

Because we are working with the transfer of expensive assets, we will have to encode all functions and callbacks using Keccak256 and padding to create encoded hash sequences in solidity.  I am still designing the framework for middleware connections to btc and the front end connections to apps on Google play and Apple.

If you are a developer and/or artist interested in contributing to this project whether it be code or art; please email aquietstgallery@gmail.com.
